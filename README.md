Your company keeps bragging about their **super secure**and **EXTREMELY** professional application that they are incredibly proud of. Curious (and slightly suspicious), you decide to **take a closer** look and see if it’s really as secure as they claim.

This my first pwn challenge I ever made sooo, if you finds things that could be changed / upgraded, feel free to contact me on my mail, *calvinhere@dmc.chat*, or on discord, **@stegomalware**

## This challenge is available at : 
**https://training.cyberwave.network/challenges** and it's named **s3cur3_4pp**

Good Luck !
